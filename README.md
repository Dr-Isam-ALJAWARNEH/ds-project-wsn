# Topic 9: Novel Approach for deploying wireless sensors networks for efficient fine-grained air quality monitoring

Focus: Optimization of Sensor Placement Strategies for Effective Urban Air Quality Monitoring 
In todayâ€™s urban environments, air quality monitoring is one of the challenges confronting municipalities to inform strategic urban planning decisions. Fueled by the urge to facilitate decision-making, wireless sensor networks are becoming prevalent leading solutions for collecting fine-grained air quality data, a capability that is attributed to the ubiquitous availability of low-cost air quality sensors. Those sensors are either fixed on specific spots in a city or mounted on moving vehicles. In either case, a deployment approach of those sensors should take financial cost minimization and network coverage into consideration, striking a plausible balance between those tradeoffs. In this research project, the aim is to tackle the problem of minimum-cost sensor node positioning for air pollution monitoring. The solution should aim at an optimal sensors location while ensuring air pollution coverage and network connectivity. A combination of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and a density-based clustering algorithm such as DBSCAN is mandatory for the project's successful implementation!
